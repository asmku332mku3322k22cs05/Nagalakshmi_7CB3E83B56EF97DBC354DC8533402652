Write a function called linear_search_product that takes the list of products and a target product 
name as input. The function should perform a linear search to find the target product in the list and 
return a list of indices of all occurrences of the product if
found, or an empty list if the product is not found.

for index,priduct in enumerate(productlist):
  if product ==targetproduct:
    indices.append(index)

  return indices


#example indices
product=["shoes","boot","loafes","sandal","shoes"]
target="shoes"
target ="apple"
result=linearsearchproduct(product,target)
